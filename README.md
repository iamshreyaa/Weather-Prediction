# Weather Prediction

## Overview

Weather Prediction is a Node.js application that provides weather forecasts based on user input. The application fetches real-time weather information from APIs and presents it in an easy-to-use interface. It predicts the weather condition of next day as well using random forest - a machine learning algorithm. Model is trained in python and then flask is used to utilize that model and integrate the real-time data with predicted model and make predictions on the basis of that. The result is displayed on screen. Flask has been integrated with NodeJs with endpoints.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Data:** Get current weather conditions for any location.
- **Weather Forecasts:** View forecast for upcoming day.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design.
## Usage
-Provide the latitude and longitude of the place you want to know the temperature, wind speed and precipitation of.
